SSIS alwyas work on server

creating project ( package ) in SSIS
click on file -- new & choose type ie BI,c++, VB programmer

In ssis package there are tabs like control flow, data flow,parameters,event handlers,package exloprer

control flow

- in control flow we have to add task for any step which we have to perform , there are so may task option available on ssis toolbox
- there are right arrow on each task, for performing step step by or in sequance then drag this green arrow on other steps
- we can also add annotation for better understanding of digrams. ( right click on page & select add annotation )
- for adding actual task to data flow task double click that task & it will automatically goto data flow tab.
- we can create three task in data flow other transform, other sources & destination. ( first connect with source & give transform data destination )

connecting to server

- in data flow we have to create source & destination Task , if we not link both then its will getting error.
- first goto solution explorer & right click on connection manager & create new ( for connecting to sql server & MS access use OLEDB )
- after that give server instance name if there is on local host then use - .\prashsql (instance name ) & choose database
- GO to data flow & add OLE DB source & link creates connection manger to this OLE DB source & assign table from particular connection ( database )
- after that create new connection for destination ( tranform data ) like excel , OLEDB , ODBC
-  if we creating first excel destination task click on new its will automatically create new table then choose that table
- after creating if you didn't save file then there will show * on page.
-  after GO to pakage & excute
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Creating Basic Packages In SSIS

for creating package --right click on ssis packages & create new
- two option for creating connection  1- right click on connection manager folder 2 - bottom of the screen connection manger window right click
- create new control flow task i e Data flow task ( in data flow task we have to give source & destination task assign connection to them )
- we can run package using F5 key , Green button on top , right click on package , set as startup object.
- if we want to excute any sql statement then add excute sql Task & change properties connection type,sql statment , connection
- for checking data which are in between two task pipeline then right click on that & enable data viewer ( it will show data on pop-up window when we excute package )

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Basic Transformation in SSIS

- for transaformation we have add transformation task between source & destination task
- if source data value not able to convert into destination then its will give error.
- DATA VIEWER option very useful we cant create table for destination at all time so we use UNION ALL as destination & enable data viewer

Row Sampling & Percentage Sampling Tranformation
- Row Sampling use for selecting random rows from data & split between selected & unselected data
- percentage use for when we want 10% or 20% data 

Union Two Table
- for this add Two source assistant ( 2 table source )	
- after link that data in union task & after union data to destination task

Difference between synchronous and asynchronous transmission is 
- In Synchronous data transfer, data is transmitted in the form of blocks or frames whereas in asynchronous data transfer, transmission is done in 1 byte or character at a time.
- sort is asynchronous & union and aggreagate partial blocking
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Creating variables in SSIS

- when we want to use row count transformation then we have to create variables
- use top right corner option ( Eraser symbol ) for creating variables. ( we can see all system variables from variable creation options )
- after creating variable give that variable to row count & if we want show the msgbox of rows count then add script task & use that variable in that script ( also add that variable to readonly variable option )
- message script code - MessageBox.Show("There are " +  Dts.Variables["RowsCount"].Value + " rows"); [for C# ]
			-  MessageBox.Show("There are " & Convert.ToString(Dts.Variables("RowsCount").Value) & " rows") [for VBA ]

-  After completing one control flow it will be run 2nd control flow ie script task & show msg
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Data type & data conversion Transformations

- when we want to imort data from excel to any destination we should close source excel otherwise it will fail package.
- while importing data from excel to any destination data type are important because excel store value in unicode string data type ( right click on excel source - advance editor-iput & output )
- if data type not match then add data conversion task between source & destination

conversion data types
string data types
	SQL			SSIS
	char,varchar		DT_str
	nchar,nvarchar		DT_wstr
	ntext			DT_Ntext
	text			DT_text

Integer & Boolean
	SQL			SSIS	
	bit			DT_bool
	tinyint			DT_UI1
	smallint		DT_I2
	int			DT_I4
	bigint			DT_I8

Floating Point data types
	SQL			SSIS
	real			DT_R4
	float			DT_R8
	decimal,numeric		DT_numeric
	money,smallmoney	DT_cy

Date & time Data types
	SQL			SSIS
	datetime,smalldatetime	DT_dbtimestamp
	date			DT_dbtime
	time			DT_dbtime2
	datetime2		DT_dbtimestamp2
	datetimeoffset		DT_dbtimestampoffset

other data types
	SQL			SSIS
	uniqueidentifier	DT_guid
	varbinary,timestamp	DT_bytes
	xml,sql_variant		DT_wstr
	image			DT_image
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Using expression in SSIS

- while creating variable we can also give expression using funtion available in SSIS
- if want to convert data type then use function from type cast
- in ssis there is no if---else function so we have to use  TERNARY ( ? ) operator

If........else
DATEPART( "dw", @[User::CurrentDate]  ) ==6  || DATEPART( "dw", @[User::CurrentDate]  ) ==7
?
"Its Weekend !!" : "Its Weekday !!"
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Conditional split & derived column transformation

- conditional split use for split data base on condition
- for this we have add condional split task between source & destination
- after spliting data for transformation on split data use derived column & replace value from that data , when we give condition in this case system auto take 570 character as text length so use DT_WSTR and truncate to 255.

Debugging In SSIS

- use output window when we want track error
- if error getting about Bit version then change 64bit option as false from project properties-package
- use data viewer for display result to check & we can also copy metadata,only particular columns show from edit option on data viewer Point.(shows pipeline data )
- we can also add breakpoint on control flow to break excution of package
- use watch & local window for variable value changes ( watch window recommended )
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Lookup Transformation in SSIS

- Lookup transformation task use for split data match on basis of another table
- for this we have to add lookup task betwen source & destination , it will give you two data i e match & unmatch

For faster performance of lookup task use Caching Data - full/ partial caching
Full cache- 	lookup table full loaded in memory
partial cache - value look in lookup table & set aside in cache so after same value look in lookuptable it will process faster ( its best when we have large amount of data)

there is one option which work faster than partial cache
- create special cache from source lookup table ( sql ) with extension .CAW & use cache transformation task in SSIS
- create one seprate data flow task for creating cache file then source task ----- cache tranform ( lookup column indexing is most imp )
- change looktable conection to cache connection & map columns
- we can create more that data flow at same time.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Sequence Containers and FOR Loops In SSIS

Task Host containers
its default containers , in this we can't create two task or variable with same name it will give error.

Sequence Containers 
- with help of this we can create two or more containers & add task into this , we will give same name to task & variable in this but not in same container,we have create two different containers.
- when we create variable by default it applied for whole package so we move variable to specific containers using move vaiable option
- with help of this we can also perform  bunch of task , for this we have to move task to container & link with other task ( within container we don't have to connect task with each other )

For Loops & Foreach loop
- most useful is Foreach loop for checking files from any folder
- using for loop we have to create one variable & configure loop by giving variable's initial value , assign expression( increament )	 , Evaluate expression ( for break the loop )
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Looping Over Files In SSIS

- if we want to delete old file from any folder then use file system task & configure, there are standard operation available in this task ie move, copy , delete
- for looping add foreach loop container & give folderpath & set which type of file to copy ( *.* means all files, *.txt* menas only text files )
- TRAVERSE SUBFOLDERS option for looping within subfolders
- for inserting variable value to sql table create parameter & use (Insert Into File_names values (?)) in execute sql task
- when we create connection this was only available for that particular package
- if we want to put if condition between two task then right click on link line-- edit---expression & create expression [ UPPER( RIGHT( @[User::FileName] , 4)  )== ".TXT" ]
- for incrementing variable value use expression task in containers
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Foreach loop For other than Files

- Ado.net is fancy word for looping over rows within schema & sql
- for storing whole row data in variable use variable type as object
- after that add excute sql task & configure and select option resultset as full result set
- after that set result set tab add result as 0

[ SQL command for show all table name from database -- select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES ]
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Script Tasks using C# In SSIS

- using script task we can show message box for input from user to which data to be perform
- after choose option one link set to failure
- for both line to activate choose right click on link line & edit select or option ( dot line show for OR )

Script Tasks using Visual Basic

- while edit script if we dont want to mention variable in redonly & redright then use variable dispencer
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Script Components In SSIS

- we have to add script component task between source & destination ( for source,destination, transformation )
- after that we have configure input & output columns
- script task automatically creates pre-excute , Post-excute precedure in script
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Expression and Other Constraints in SSIS

- there two constaints precedence & Expression constraints
- precedence constraints means if previous task failed, complete, success then it will go to next task as per failure , success & completion ( just right click on Task link line )

- expression constraints means if we want to do specific task base on condition or expression then use this constaints
- it also has AND & OR so if we have multiple constainsts then use so it will show dot link lines.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Event-handling and logging In SSIS

- Event hadling its like task which are perform when specific event has been trigger
- goto event handler - select task & select events like post-excute, pre-excute, on-error
- we can also track event hander on package exprolrer & on particular package folder

To Logining in ssis
- Goto Extension-- SSIS-- logging - add file
- we can log all package data or any indiviual task , there is tick option available
- if we wan to audit data side by side then use audit task add columns

Error Handling In SSIS

- if we want to split data bas on number of characters in columns then use data conversion task -- add revised column - redirect row
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Parameters and deployment in SSIS

For crating catlog in SQL server goto database -- management -- integration services catlog
for deploy project to sql server right click on projects -- deploy -- select instance name
- its useful if we want to run package from sql server

- excute package from sql server requires parameter if we want to run package then click ok so it will be run without parameter & if we requires sql statement then goto script and edit
-  for create parameter goto projects-- parameter & we can use this parameter on sql task same as variables ( $ sign shown before parameter name )

creating environment in SQL server
- its very same senario if we are using same senarios again again
- if we dont want give parameter again again then create senarios( environments)
- for create goto catlog-- projects -- environment after create go to particular package & reference this environment
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

SSAS

- SSAS is same as RDBMS database but its store data in commpressed manner, its contains cubes which stores data
- with help of commpress query are process much faster.
- we can use mdx & dax query for calculations
- we can connect to any reporting tool using ssas , also we can pivot data if we have excel connection.

SSAS Architecture

RDBMS - SSAS ( Cubes ) - end user

roles of ssas developer
cube design , scripting ( some time ) , mdx , processing configuring  backup & restore cubes , apply security in ssis

Imp Terms
Data Source:
Data Source is a kind of connection string. It establishes a connection between the analysis database and RDBMS.

Data Source View:
Data source view is a logical model of Database

Cube:
A cube is a basic unit of storage. It is a collection of data which has been aggregated to allow queries to return data quickly.

MOLAP:
The MOLAP is made of data cube which contains of measures and dimensions. It includes all the members who may be in a hierarchical relationship.

It is specific set of rule which helps you to determine how certain cells are computed in a sparse cube and measures values rolled up inside that hierarchies.

Dimension Table
A dimension table contains dimensions of a fact.
They are joined to fact table using a foreign key.
Dimension tables are de-normalized tables.
Dimensions offer characteristics of the facts with the help of their attributes.
Not offers limit set for a given number of dimensions
The dimension contains one or more hierarchical relationships.
Dimension:
Dimension offers the context surrounding a business process event. In simple terms, they give who, what, where of a fact. In the Sales business process, for the fact sales number, dimensions would be who customer Names.

Where – Location
What – Product Name
In other words, you can say that a dimension is a window to view the information in the facts.
Level:
Each type of summary which can be retrieved from the single dimension is called label.

Fact Table:
A fact table is the most important table in a dimensional model. A Fact Table contains Measurements/fact and Foreign key to the dimension table. For example, payroll operations.

Measure:
Each fact table contains one or more table which should be analyzed. For example, a book sells information table. It can be a profit or loss for the number of book's sold.

Schema:
The database schema of a database system and its structure described in a formal language. It supports the database management system. The term "schema" means to the organization of data as a blueprint of a manner of which database is constructed.

SSAS Cube Design | Cube Development in SSAS

There are two types of SSAS 1 - multidimensional 2 - tabular
- cubes are part of multidimentional model
- measure & dimensions both are requires for creating cubes.
- if we are not aware of fact & dimentsion table then there is suggest option it will auto select fact table.( not recommended not give correct )

Solution explorer contains (one solution contains multiple projects.)

data sources		- for creation of connection string
data source view	- for selecting which tables requires 
cubes 			- its contains Tabs - cube structures , dimension usage,calculation,kpi,actions,partitions,aggregations,perspectives,translations,browser
dimensions 
mining structures 
roles 
assemblies 
miscllaneous
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SSAS Named Queries | SSAS Named Calculations

- name queries use when we requires only certain columns from tables in data source view design.
- for replce existing query with name query ( with certain column Table ) Right click on that query- replace - with name Query
- for adding any calculate column in query then use Right click on that query- new named calculation-give column name & sql statement

	select  FirstName,gender,'Gen' = case when Gender = 'M' then 'Male' else 'Female' end 
		from DimCustomer
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SSAS Cube Deployment


Deployment Process
- if we want to check any errors in project then Right click on project - Build 
- after checking error Right Click on project - properties - & give server name , database name
- check impersonation information before deploy if there option selected ( use credentials of currect user ) then we will get error (You cannot deploy the model because the localhost\prashsql deployment server is not running in multidimensional mode.)
- use option ( use service account ) in impersonation to correctly deploy project.

impersonation has four option 
1- User specific widows user name & password
2- Use the service account
3- User credential of current user ( it will not work when cube deployment )
4- Inherit ( it wil set default option set at database level in Sql ssas server )

Cube Deployment to Production or Testing environment

option 1
- for this we have to create XML file & send it to particular team
- for XML creation Goto local ssas server right click on database-particular project - Script Database as 

option 2
open deployment wizard & and give bin folder access
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Tabular Model in SSAS | Introduction to Tabular Model in SSAS

- it is in-memory database. its suitable for power bi data sources
- if we want work on both multi-dimensional & tabular model on same machine then we have to installed Analysis services two time i e for each.
- create ssas tabular model & give server name ( localhost\prashsql)
- import data from sql server goto extension-model-import from data source, give server name and select table.(select related table option help to identify specfic table related to others. )
- after importing data if we deploy project then it save to ssas databse.if we dont deploy then databse automatically remove from databases.
- after deploy we can use that databse for power bi data source.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Perspectives in SSAS | ssas cube perspectives

- perspective as same as view in RDBMS ( sql, azure ),perspective & sql view both has same behaviour.
- Sql views generated from table,its subset of tables.perspective derived/generated from cubes.its subset of cubes.
- it is useful when we want to see other user only certain data then it is best option.then gives the rights to specific user.
- Goto Cube design - Perspective tab - create new - tick \ untick field.
- For test Cube goto Browser tab & select Cube.(perspective is virtual cube )
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SSAS Cube Connectivity and Usage | access ssas cube data in excel

check cube connectivity via
- in SSDT 
- in SSMs - analysis services 
- through MS excel ( reporting very simple using this option )goto data - import data from analysis service & give server name.(in excel)
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
MDX Introduction

- after cube creation, design , delpoy we can start MDX calculation queries. MDX generated more permutation & combination.
- SQL /orcale are 2 dimensional queries, its contain rows & columns only.
- For creating mdx query we requires two component Member & Measure. Member comes from Dimensional attributes , Measure comes from Fact attributes.

Basic Syntax - 
SQL - Select id,name from emp (here we can select record from only one table)
MDX - Select Member/Measure on row ( for alias directly replace with row )
	Select Member/Measure on Column From Cube Name


Tuples in MDX
- tuples are help to identify data uniquely & in details.
- tuples form with help of dimensional members.( group of dimentional member, its not use for fact measures.)
- one member from one dimension & other member from other dimensions ( we can not take two member from same dimension in tuples)
- tuples are mention between paranthaesis.

Basic Syntax
	Select Member/Measure on row ( for alias directly replace with row )
	Select (member1,member2) on Column From Cube Name
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Create Hierarchies in SSAS

- click on that dimension on which we have to create hierarchies.
- after that if there is atrributes not added to list then drag from column to attributes & create hierachies by draging field one by one.
- a system or organization that has many levels from the lowest to the highest
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Key Performance Indicators in SSAS

- it is helps to identify business statergy like business is going good or bad.its combination of calculations.
- goto KPI - create new KPI & give name ,select fact table, value expression , goal expression,status expression(sql case statements) ,select status indicator.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Difference between tuples and sets in mdx

- Tuples are mention between paranthesis 	sets are mention between curly braces.
- both are use for uniquely identify data. 
- set are useful when we requires member from same dimension. ( e.g. sales from year 2014 & 2015 )

Tuples Basic syntax

	SELECT [Measure].[sales amount] on columns
	([Dim date].[calender year].&[2014],[Dim sales territory].[sales territory region].&[India] on rows
	From [adventures Works dw2016]

Sets Syntax

	SELECT [Measure].[sales amount] on columns
	{[Dim date].[calender year].&[2014],[Dim date].[calender year].&[2015] } on rows
	From [adventures Works dw2016]
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Cube Partitions in SSAS

- if we have big data in cube so use partition , it will run in background end user will not see that partition.
- it is best option to enhance cube performance.
- partition is split the fact\measure group into smaller group base on specific columns.
- by default every cube has one partition per meausre group.we have to change that to multiple partition.
- Goto Partition-- New partition- select Query binding\table binding--- on query binding mention SQL query to partition data.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Cube Processing in SSAS

- there are two option for cube processing 1- mannually 2- automate ( using ssis package.)
- if we want to deploy on structure then Goto project properties--deployment-precessing-dont process.( it will not deploy data.)
- there five option for precess cube-
1 - process full - 	it will precess data + structure.
2 - process default - 	if you are precessing cube first time then it will precess data + structure.
3 - process data -	it will precess data ( if we change any schema change then it will not work)
4 - process structure -	it only precess structure.
5 - process clear - 	it will drop data from cube.After the data is dropped, it is not reloaded.

Cube Process through SSIS Package (Automatic)

- if we already deploy cube then we have refresh that on interval basis because data coming day by day.for upto date we have use process options.
- Analysis processing task which are help us to process cube & dimension in SSAS.
- configure task -- give server name & add what object(filed) we need to be refresh.

Automate SSAS Cube Process using SSIS 

- if we want refresh cube on monthly,weekly,daily then we have to first link cube to SSIS package.
- for automation we have to link SQL server Agent to SSIS
- after that create job-- give ssis package for precessing & schedule it.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Case & Conditional Statement in MDX

- if we have to test multiple condition in mdx then best practice is to use case statetment.( we can also use If....else)
- we can also create common table expression & use it in mdx query.

syntax
	** Creating CTE
	WITH Member [Meaures].[Salescondition] AS	
	CASE
	WHEN [Meaures].[Sales Amount]> 4000 THEN 'Good'
	WHEN [Meaures].[Sales Amount]< 4000 AND [Meaures].[Sales Amount]> 0 THEN 'Okay'
	WHEN [Meaures].[Sales Amount]= 0 THEN 'No Proft No Loss'
	WHEN [Meaures].[Sales Amount]< 0 THEN 'Loss'
	END

	** Creating MDX
	SELECT { [Meaures].[Salescondition],[Meaures].[Sales Amount] } ON Columns,
	[Due Date].[Calendar Year] ON Rows
	FROM [Adventures Works DW2016]
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Rank Function in MDX

SQL syntax

	SELECT * , Rank() OVER(order by SALARY DESC)
	FROM [Sample].[dbo].[Employee]

- for using rank function in MDX we have to first create order set.

MDX Syntax

	WITH SET Region AS	** created order set
	ORDER (
	[Dim Sales Territory].[Sales Territory Region].[Sales Territory Region],
	[Measures].[Sales Amount] )
	
	Member [Measure].[SalesRank] AS		** Created Calculate measure
	Rank ( [Dim Sales Territory].[Sales Territory Region].Currentmember,Region)

	Select { [Measure].[Sales Amount] ,[Measure].[SalesRank] } ON COLUMNS	
	Regions ON ROWS
	FROM [Adventures Works DW2016]
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
SSRS

- with help of this we can visualised data in proper manner.
- we can create report using report builder & report designer
- its is XML base file & its extenion is .rdl

type of report
enterprise report - its is use for following business standard (for business)
add hoc - no business
embedded report - its embedded in thrid party application like .net , java 


SSRS architecture

Data source -- report server -- report builder
report server database -- report manager -- report builder ( report manger is end user & it is web application)
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Creating SSRS report

- after creating new report in ssrs , solution explorer contains shared data sources,shared database,reports.
- add new report to report folder right click folder

Data source & Shared data sources
- with help of data source we can create connection string between ssrs & dat sources, its is private connectin
- shared data sources is public coneection, we can use this for multiple report.

Shared Data set & Embedded Data sets
- Embedded data set create at particular report level, shared data set we can use within entire project.

Data Region
- when we will create report in ssrs it will comes under data region,there 5 data regions.(table,matrix,chart,list,Guage)
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
LIST REPORT IN SSRS | LIST IN SSRS

- goto report -- create new report
- in toolbox there various types of repot available.
- list report does not have any specific layout
- if we create new list report in sssrs & add textbox and table then we have to group that both.

CHART REPORT IN SSRS

- its help to show data in graphical manner.(line ,bar etc.)

LIMITATIONS OF REPORT WIZARD IN SSRS 
- with help of report wizard we cant create report with multiple data set.
- it is does not allowes paramaterized report.
- wizard support only table & matrix report.


Expressions IN SSRS 

- if we want show customized value apart from database value then use expressions.
- it is use for to perform complex calculations,for dynamic bahviour of report,to pass paramerter,to show detail or aggreegate data in report.

TYPES OF REPORTS IN SSRS
- parmaterized report
- linked report
- snapshot report
- cascaded report
- ad hoc report
- drill down report
- drill through report
- sub report
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
PARAMETERIZED REPORT IN SSRS

- its take user input and generate report
- there two type of report single value & multiple value
- for multiple value parameter we have create seprate dataset & select that data set in report

steps
- create new report
- create data source
- create parameter
- create dataset
- link parameter & dataset
- design the report
- observe output

CASCADED PARAMETERS IN SSRS

- it is nothing but one parameter depends on another parameter,order of parameter is very important.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
ACTIONS IN SSRS

there are three action in SSRS when we click on Particular field value (shows hand symbol when we hover on field )

- Goto Bookmarks
- Goto Reports
- Goto URL

Go to URL IN SSRS
- Goto design report-Right click on fild text box--text box properties--action


LOOKUP IN SSRS

- it is same as we use join data in sql server
- it is very usefull when we have to join data data from different source like one from sql server & another from flat file


Conditional Formatting in SSRS 

- Goto design report-Right click on fild text box--text box properties--Font
	=iif(Fields!BoxOfficeDollars.Value>555000000,"LimeGreen","Red")


CALCULATED FIELDS IN SSRS

- it is calculated field base on user input like if user want tax,bonus etc.
- right click on dataset-add calculated field- give expression- select same filed in report

CUSTOM .NET CODE IN SSRS

- with help of code we can calculate column in report
- Right Click on report-- report properties--Code
- after that right click on column--expression -- use (=Code.status(Fields!Salary.Value))
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Sub Reports in SSRS

- it is occupy space in main report
- if we want insert subreport in main report then both should be on same project.
- create main report n then on column insert sub report & set properties.

SSRS LINKED REPORTS

- it is use when we deploy report to report manager & we want show only specific data.
- it is derived report from exisiting report.
- Goto report server url & From original report create linked report & set parameter
